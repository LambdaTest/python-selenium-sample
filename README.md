* [Local Testing With Python](#testing-locally-hosted-or-privately-hosted-projects)

## Prerequisites

Before you can start performing **Python** automation testing with **Selenium**, you would need to:

* Install the latest Python build from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). We recommend using the latest version.
* Make sure **pip** is installed in your system. You can install **pip** from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
* Download the latest **Selenium Client** and its **WebDriver bindings** from the [official website](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/). Latest versions of **Selenium Client** and **WebDriver** are ideal for running your automation script on LambdaTest Selenium cloud grid.

### Installing Selenium Dependencies And Tutorial Repo

**Step 1:** Clone the LambdaTest’s python-selenium-sample repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/python-selenium-sample
cd python-selenium-sample
```

**Step 2:** Download the driver from the link, or you can use **pip** to install it.
```bash
pip install selenium
export PYTHONWARNINGS="ignore:Unverified HTTPS request"   //Disable ssl warning
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts. You can get these credentials from the [LambdaTest Automation Dashboard](https://automation.lambdatest.com/build/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=python-selenium-sample) or by your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/login/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=python-selenium-sample).

**Step 2:** Set LambdaTest **Username** and **Access Key** in environment variables.

* For **Linux/macOS**:
  
  ```bash
  export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
  export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```
  * For **Windows**:
  ```bash
  set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
  set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
  ```

## Run Your First Test

>**Test Scenario**: 



### Configuration Of Your Test Capabilities

**Step 4:** In the python script, you need to update your test capabilities. In this code, we are passing browser, browser version, and operating system information, along with LambdaTest Selenium grid capabilities via capabilities object. 

The capabilities object in the above code are defined as:

```python
 # Desired capabilities for the test
        desired_caps = {
            'LT:Options': {
                "build": "Auto Heal Demo",
                "name": "Auto Heal Enabled",
                "platformName": "Windows 10",
                "autoHeal": 'true',
            },
            "browserName": "Chrome",
            "browserVersion": "latest",
        }
}
```
You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt [Desired Capability Generator](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=python-selenium-sample).

### Executing The Test

**Execution Steps:**
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


3. Run the test:
   ```
   python autoHealingEnableDemo.py && python autoHealingDisableDemo.py
   ```
Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on LambdaTest automation dashboard. 


## Testing Locally Hosted Or Privately Hosted Projects

You can test your locally hosted or privately hosted projects with LambdaTest Selenium grid using LambdaTest Tunnel. All you would have to do is set up an SSH tunnel using tunnel and pass toggle `tunnel = True` via desired capabilities. LambdaTest Tunnel establishes a secure SSH protocol based tunnel that allows you in testing your locally hosted or privately hosted pages, even before they are live.

Refer our [LambdaTest Tunnel documentation](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/testing-locally-hosted-pages/) for more information.

Here’s how you can establish LambdaTest Tunnel.

Download the binary file of:
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Windows](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/windows/64bit/LT_Windows.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for macOS](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/mac/64bit/LT_Mac.zip)
* [LambdaTest Tunnel for Linux](https://downloads.lambdatest.com/tunnel/v3/linux/64bit/LT_Linux.zip)

Open command prompt and navigate to the binary folder.

Run the following command:

```bash
LT -user {user’s login email} -key {user’s access key}
```
So if your user name is lambdatest@example.com and key is 123456, the command would be:

```bash
LT -user lambdatest@example.com -key 123456
```
Once you are able to connect **LambdaTest Tunnel** successfully, you would just have to pass on tunnel capabilities in the code shown below :

**Tunnel Capability**

```
"tunnel" : true
```
